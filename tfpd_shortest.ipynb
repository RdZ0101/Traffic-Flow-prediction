    "- There is an average delay of 30 seconds to pass each controlled intersection\n",
    "- The answer is you don't calculate the travel time between 2 arbitrary SCATS sites directly, but you need to calculate the travel time between 2 adjacent SCATS sites along the route and add them up at the end.\n",
    "- time = distance/speed (1)\n",
    "- Because the distance between 2 adjacent SCATS sites is fixed, you just need a function to convert from traffic flow to speed, and then you can use the distance and speed to calculate time according to equation (1).\n",
